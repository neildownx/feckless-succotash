Xperia SP Omni-X

Omni do not support our Xperia SP so here is a little something we cooked
A Ported Rom Stable for daily use with great results on Stock Kernel

Omni is a community-based project for the Android community which is Free: Free to Use, Free to Modify,
Free to Share. It's also about options, which is the beauty of Android. We know not everyone wants to update their ROM daily,
and you are free to update as frequently or infrequently as you like. Omni is about flexibility and giving users what they expect
and we are excited to see where the community goes with it.
